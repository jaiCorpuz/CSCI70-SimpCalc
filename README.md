# Ensure that you have python already installed within your machine

# I hereby attest to the truth of the following facts:

# I have not discussed the Python code in my program with anyone
# other than my instructor or the teaching assistants and my partner for the project assigned to this course.

# I have not used Python code obtained from another student, or
# any other unauthorized source, whether modified or unmodified.

# If any Python code or documentation used in my program was
# obtained from another source, it has been clearly noted with citations in the
# comments of my program.

# This import allows files to be found by pathnames using pattern matching rules similar to the Unix shell to scan all the files in the directory
